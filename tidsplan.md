# week 6
- [x] read all the research papers. febuary 8. 
- [x] Meting med Scape
- [ ] Begin on week 7 goals
- [ ] Understand
    - disparity estimation

# week 7
- GOAL: goal is to generate a proof of concept for the data pipeline
- MAIN question, does the data have labels, or do we need to generate them ourselves?
- [x] download some stereo images datasets, sceneflow, Kitti(maybe)
- [x] follow guide at [disparity estimation](https://learnopencv.com/disparity-estimation-using-deep-learning/?fbclid=IwAR2WVHKkiD8bgcwWgYHxrQOn5oB_qpwQnGa2sVMwENm-Y6s6iX85VdG8eR8)
    - two input images, left and right, look at output
- [ ] generate a neural network for distance estimation 
- [ ] test openCV for object detection, hvis det giver mening.
- [ ] generate logic to output the distance from the object detected as the closest
- [x] read and annotate research articles, there is some conventions we need to understand such as
    - No ReLu in final layer in convolutions why
    - conditional random fields (CRF)
    - semantic segmentation
    - unary terms
    - "such as semi global block matching and left-right consistency checks"
    - how is a disparity map generated
    - univalued disparity, with respect to a reference image
    - disparity space representation
- [ ] Make a neural network on scene flow, with some metrics

# week 8
- [ ] generate a neural network for distance estimation 
- [ ] Skrive state of the art afsnit, draft
    - struktur
    - udvælgelse af artikler
    - skrive draft
- [ ] Deconstruct the codebase, and understand the codebase and apply the codebase
- [ ] SCAPE cameras are ready for usage, gather data
    - når de kalder, så kaster vi det vi har i hendærne
- [ ] Litteratursøg på object detection
